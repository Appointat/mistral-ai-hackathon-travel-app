The student, currently enrolled in a university's computer science program, has taken introductory courses in data structures and algorithms, providing them with a solid computational foundation. 
The upcoming tutoring session is intended to expand on this by introducing more complex concepts in machine learning. 
The discussion will not only cover theoretical differences between deep learning and traditional machine learning but will also offer real-world application examples such as image recognition for deep learning and spam detection for traditional machine learning. 
Additionally, the session will address the intensive computational resources deep learning requires, such as GPUs for training neural networks, contrasting with the less resource-intensive needs of many traditional machine learning techniques.
